# multipdfdownloader

____README_____

V 0.0.1

This app was created mainly for students of the FH Dortmund, Germany.

Our library has some books available as PDF ebooks. However, sometimes, you have
to download every single chapter by itself, which annoys me. So I decided to 
make an app that downloads all the PDF files at once and puts them together into 
one file.

Right now, it's far from finished. Right now, it only has some bases set up to
download from links with href values that end with '.pdf'. It also downloads
the files onto the server, so it caan't be used as a web service.

While it was made for the above mentioned purpose, it could be used for any site 
with .pdf download links in the future. However, I do not take responsibility 
for how it is used.

Note that if you do want to use it for the intended purpose, you'll still have
to be in the FH Dortmund's network.
